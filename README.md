# Homepage

This is a simple homepage that I wanted to make, I was getting tired of the new tab page that Chrome has by default, and I didn't like how I was accessing my bookmarks, so this is the (early) result.

### Credits
+ JQuery as always.
+ SimpleWeather.js (http://simpleweatherjs.com/) for making it simple to get weather.
+ paul del signore for his hovering css @codepen.io/pdelsignore/pen/ldkje
+ Fabrizio Bianchi's CSS only weather icons http://codepen.io/fbrz/pen/iqtlk
