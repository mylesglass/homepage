# Homepage

This is a simple homepage that I wanted to make, I was getting tired of the new tab page that Chrome has by default, and I didn't like how I was accessing my bookmarks, so this is the (early) result.

I am new to making things for the web, so I am starting with small projects to help me learn various things. Javascript seems cool.

The header area changes colour depanding on the current local weather and time. I think it's kinda cool. When you hover over it you get Kanye West quotes, because sometimes that's just what you need.

### Future plans
+ To use some sort of fluid grid to make the layout responsive for all devices.
+ Add more weather animations.

### Credits
+ JQuery fo sho.
+ [SimpleWeather.js](http://simpleweatherjs.com/) by James Fleeting [@fleetingftw](https://twitter.com/fleetingftw) for making it simple to get weather. Brilliant.
+ Paul Del Signore for his hovering CSS [Pen](http://codepen.io/pdelsignore/pen/ldkJe) used on the heading.
+ [Fabrizio Bianchi](https://www.behance.net/fabriziob) for his CSS only weather icons [pen](http://codepen.io/fbrz/pen/iqtlk). Beautiful animations that I could not pass up using.
